Bear with me, this is my first time writing Zig.

- Everything (so far) being available from a single `@import("std")` is nice. Let's see how long until I eat those words.
- I'm going to need some time to get along with how C-strings and `[]u8` map into each other.
- I cannot fathom how Zig makes reading a file *harder than C++*.
- I don't understand how `var a = <something>; var b = a.field;` is different from `var b = <something>.field;` and I don't know how to query for that (yet).
- What is the bloody deal with explicit allocators everywhere, I'm going to have to read a lot here.
- I am not going to be friends with the `.*` dereferencing syntax. `i.*[1..]` is just the worst.
